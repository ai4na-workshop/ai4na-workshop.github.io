Stephan Eismann leads the Machine Learning Team at Atomic AI,
where he focuses on developing new technology to discover RNA-targeting medicines. Prior to
joining Atomic, he did his PhD in the AI Laboratory at Stanford University where his research
centered on novel machine learning algorithms to tackle complex problems in biomolecular structure
prediction. Originally from Germany, he studied physics in Heidelberg and London before moving to
the US. He is a co-founder of the Machine Learning for Structural Biology workshop at NeurIPS,
and his research has been published in Science and Nature as well as at NeurIPS and ICML.
