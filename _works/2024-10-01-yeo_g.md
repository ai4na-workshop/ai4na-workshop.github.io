Grace Yeo is a GIS/BII Fellow in the Single Cell and Spatial Omics Domain at GIS. She received her PhD from MIT in the Computational and Systems Biology program under the supervision of Dr. David Gifford. During her PhD, she developed computational analysis pipelines for novel scRNA-based perturbation assays, as well as deep learning methods for modeling biological processes such as cellular differentiation. At GIS, she works closely with the Shyam Prabhakar Lab to develop imaging and downstream analysis pipelines for spatial DNA and RNA assays applied to colorectal cancer. Her research interests revolve around the integration of modern machine learning methods with state-of-the-art â€“omic technologies for studying complex biological systems.
