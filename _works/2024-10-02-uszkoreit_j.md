Jakob Uszkoreit co-founded Inceptive in 2021 with the goal of enabling a new generation of medicines reminiscent of software but running on our cells. Inceptive aims to accomplish this by learning life's languages with a unique combination of cutting-edge deep learning and novel, scalable biochemistry experiments. Before Inceptive, Jakob conducted research on deep learning at Google Brain, including co-authoring the research papers titled "Attention Is All You Need" and "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words". Earlier, he built the language understanding team behind Google Assistant and many Google Search features and worked on Google Translate during its early days.
