<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The topics focus on applications of AI and novel AI methods for RNA and DNA research including, but not limited to:</p>
- **Nucleic Acid Structure and Function:** *RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction, RNA function analysis, NA interactions*
- **Foundation and Generative Models for Nucleic Acids:** *(Multimodal) NA foundation models, Generative models for NAs*
- **Nucleic Acids in Therapeutics:** *NA drug design and discovery, NA modification, NA mutations*
- **Genomic Data Analysis:** *Genome reconstruction, Gene expression, Calling genetic variants, Pairwise and multiple NA sequence alignment, Single-cell transcriptomics and genomics*

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Submission Instructions</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">AI4NA considers two types of submissions:</p>

- **Full-Paper Submissions** --- AI4NA seeks for high-quality full-paper submissions that fit the workshop scope.
- **Tiny-Paper Submissions** --- AI4NA will host the [Tiny Paper](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers) submission track as a 
part of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative. This way AI4NA is offering opportunities for underrepresented, 
underprivileged, and first-time submitters to share their work at the workshop.

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Double blind reviewing</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Submissions will be double blind: 
reviewers cannot see author names when conducting reviews, 
and authors cannot see reviewer names. Having papers on ArXiv 
is allowed per the dual submission policy outlined below.</p>

Authors can revise their paper as many times as needed up to the
paper submission deadline. Changes to the paper will not be allowed
while the paper is being reviewed.


<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Presentation and Publication</h4>
Accepted papers will be showcased as posters during the workshop, 
with a few chosen for spotlight presentations based on reviewer feedbacks. 
At least one contributed talk slot (2 talks) will be dedicated to 
Tiny-Paper submission track. While the workshop is non-archival and does
not publish proceedings, authors of accepted papers will have the 
option to make their work available through the workshop website. 

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">We encourage submissions of:</h4>
- Novel research currently under submission.
- Promising work-in-progress results seeking feedback.
- Forward-thinking position papers initiating community discussion.


<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Style files and Templates</h4>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">To prepare your submission to AI4NA,
please use the LaTeX style files provided here. Please do not alter
the style in these templates â€“ in particular, do not compress the 
paper format by reducing the vertical spaces or the page margins.</p>

Submissions will be entirely electronic and done through [OpenReview](#).

-----------------------


- Can I opt-out of the collated proceeding?




### What can I get out of submitting?
All accepted submissions (including free text) can submit a poster for in-person and online presentation. Accepted posters and/or free text will be collated in an informal proceeding.

Some submissions will be selected for a contributed 10 minute talk (see schedule).

Some submissions will be selected for prizes (TBD).

Students from underrepresented communities submitting free text and accepted into the workshop can request financial assistance to attend ICML, which will be granted based on availability of funds.

### Free text submission guidelines
- Initial submissions can be up to 5 pages long. This limit excludes data availability statements, references and appendices, which can take unlimited space. But the reviewers are not required to read appendices. Accepted papers can be up to 6 pages long, not including acknowledgements, data availability statements, references and appendices.

### What about the camera ready version?
You will have the opportunity to submit a "camera ready" version of your poster/free text after notification of acceptance.

### Can I opt-out of the collated proceeding?
While the workshop is non-archival, we will collate camera-ready submissions into a proceeding available on this website for later download.

You can opt-out of having your camera-ready submission included by selecting this option on the submission form post-acceptance.
