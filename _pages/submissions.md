<h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Other AI for Science Workshops</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you feel that your work is not a good 
thematic fit for the AI4NA workshop, consider submitting to one of the
other AI for science workshops at ICLR 2025, such as:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a href="https://iclragenticai.github.io/" target="_blank">Towards Agentic AI for Science: Hypothesis Generation, Comprehension, Quantification, and Validation</a> </li> 
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a href="https://www.gembio.ai/" target="_blank">Generative and Experimental Perspectives for Biomolecular Design</a> </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> <a href="https://multiscale-ai.github.io/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Multiscale Processes</a> 
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Submission Instructions</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">AI4NA considers two types of submissions:</p>

- **Full-Paper Submissions** --- AI4NA seeks for high-quality full-paper submissions that fit the workshop scope.
- **Tiny-Paper Submissions** --- This year, ICLR is discontinuing the separate ‚ÄúTiny Papers‚Äù track, and is instead requiring each workshop to accept short (3‚Äì5 pages in ICLR format, exact page length to be determined by each workshop) paper submissions, with an eye towards inclusion; see [https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers) for more details. Authors of these papers will be earmarked for potential funding from ICLR, but need to submit a separate application for Financial Assistance that evaluates their eligibility. This application for Financial Assistance to attend ICLR 2025 will become available on [https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/) at the beginning of February and close on March 2nd.

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Full-Paper Submissions</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Submitted full papers can be up to 6 
    pages long, not including Software and Data, References and Appendix.
    Any paper exceeding this length will automatically be rejected.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Authors may use as many pages of appendices
    (after the bibliography) as they wish, but reviewers are not required 
    to read the appendix.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Do not include author information, 
    author contributions or acknowledgments in your initial submission.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">References must include page numbers 
    whenever possible and be as complete as possible. Place multiple 
    citations in chronological order.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Keep your abstract brief and 
    self-contained, one paragraph and roughly 4-6 sentences. 
    The title should have content words capitalized.</p>
<p>Authors are advised to use the Full-Paper AI4NA LaTeX style
    adjusted from the ICLR 2025 LaTeX style files obtainable at 
    the Style Files and Templates section below. </p>


<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Tiny-Paper Submissions</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Write a paper with the same structure as seen 
    in full papers, but with at most 3 pages of main text (including title and
    abstract). Software and Data, 
    URM Statement, References, and Appendices sections do not count towards 
    the page limit, but we do not recommend dissecting a regular-length 
    paper into a Tiny Paper by moving the majority of the content into 
    appendices. Any paper exceeding 3 pages of main text will automatically
    be rejected.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">It is recommended to have 1-2 figures, 
    1 table, and 4-5 sections. But authors are free to use their own 
    structure.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">As the Tiny Papers is a Diversity,
    Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiative, we require every submission 
    to have at least one key author (its first or last author) that meets 
    the underrepresented minority (URM) criteria. 
    Authors don't have to reveal how they qualify, and may just 
    self-identify that they qualify.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Authors are advised to use the Tiny-Paper
    AI4NA LaTeX style adjusted from the ICLR 2025 LaTeX style files 
    obtainable at the Style Files and Templates section below. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the wide range of topics that 
    could benefit from the Tiny-Paper format, we focus the type of 
    submissions to be the following:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> An implementation and experimentation of a novel 
            (not published elsewhere) yet simple idea, 
            or a modest and self-contained theoretical result </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> A follow-up experiment to or re-analysis of a previously 
            published paper </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> A new perspective on a previously published paper </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Submissions have to include a "URM Statement"
    section which acklnowledges meeting the URM criteria. See the 
    corresponding section in our provided Tiny-Paper LaTex teamplate
    for examples.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> The URM criteria typically refers to someone 
    whose age, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic makeup, 
    or identity is far from the majority members in the community. Based on
    the <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForTinyPapers" target="_blank">ICLR Guidelines</a>,
    here is a list of examples of author characteristics which were
    typically underrepresented:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Age: outside the range of 30-50 years</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Gender: does not identify as cis-male</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Sexual orientation: does not identify as heterosexual</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Geographical: not located in North America,
                                    Western Europe and UK, or East Asia</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Race: non-White</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Person with a disability</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> In addition, underprivileged researchers 
    and first-time submitters also qualify:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Underprivileged: not affiliated with
                                    a funded organization or team whose primary 
                                    goal is research</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> First-time submitters: have never submitted 
                                    to ICLR or similar conferences
</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Double Blind Reviewing</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Submissions will be double blind: 
reviewers cannot see author names when conducting reviews, 
and authors cannot see reviewer names. Having papers on ArXiv 
is allowed per the dual submission policy outlined below.</p>
<p>Authors can revise their paper as many times as needed up to the
paper submission deadline. Changes to the paper will not be allowed
while the paper is being reviewed.</p>
 
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">We encourage submissions of:</h4>
- Novel research currently under submission.
- Promising work-in-progress results seeking feedback.
- Forward-thinking position papers initiating community discussion.


<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Style Files and Templates</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">To prepare your submission to AI4NA,
please use the LaTeX style files provided here. Please do not alter
the style in these templates ‚Äì in particular, do not compress the 
paper format by reducing the vertical spaces or the page margins.</p>

Submissions will be entirely electronic and done through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/).
