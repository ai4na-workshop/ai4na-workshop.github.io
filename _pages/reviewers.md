<h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Call for Reviewers</h2>
If you still have not applied and would like to help in reviewing submissions,
you can find our reviewer form
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffOqB69EjcDN9E_dJ_lvSRMKg7NBCKTkWc7afWa8j0-jOZ_w/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>!

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Your Role</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">As a reviewer you are central to the program creation process for
AI4NA. Your Area Chairs (ACs) and the Program Chairs (PCs) will rely greatly on your 
expertise and your diligent and thorough reviews to make decisions on each paper. 
Therefore, your role as a reviewer is critical to ensuring a strong program for AI4NA.</p>
<p>High-quality reviews are also very valuable for helping authors improve their work, whether 
it is eventually accepted by AI4NA, or not. Therefore it is important to treat each valid
submission with equal care.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Instructions</h2>
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Blind Reviews</h4>
<p>Authors were asked to take reasonable efforts to hide their identities,
 including not listing their names or affiliations and omitting acknowledgments.
 This information will of course be included in the final version. Reviewers 
 should also make all efforts to keep their identity invisible to the authors. 
 ArXiv papers are not considered prior work since they have not been peer reviewed.
 Therefore, you should review your papers independently as if the arXiv 
 papers didn't exist. Citations to these papers are not required and failing to 
 cite or beat performance of arXiv papers are not grounds for rejection. An important
 general guideline is to make every effort to treat papers fairly whether or not they 
 know (or suspect) who wrote them. Reviewers should not search for the authors of a 
 paper, and complain that the paper is not anonymous if they happen to find them.</p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Check Your Papers</h4>
As soon as you get your reviewing assignment, please go through all the assigned papers to make sure
that (a) there is no obvious conflict with you (e.g., a paper authored by your recent collaborator 
from a different institution) and (b) you feel comfortable to review the paper assigned. 
If either of these issues arise, please let us know right away by contacting your the Area Chair 
using OpenReview.

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">What to Look For</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Minor flaws can be corrected and shouldn't be a reason to 
reject a paper. Acceptance and rejection decisions should not be determined solely by the method's 
raw performance. Rather, it is important to weigh both the novelty and potential impact 
of the work on the society alongside the reported performance. Impact can be on the 
research community, but also on the specific problem being addressed.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Each short paper that is accepted should be 
technically sound and make a contribution to the field.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the potential impact of a proposition is one of 
the most important criteria. Some problems do not require technical novelty, but instead 
thoughtful application of existing methods. Papers in that category (i.e. impactful but 
not necessarily novel) should not be rejected for this reason only.</p>

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Writing Technical Reviews</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Here are some specific issues to keep in mind as you write your reviews:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Extremely short reviews are unhelpful to authors, other reviewers, and Area Chairs. 
    If you have agreed to review a paper, you should take enough time to write a thoughtful and detailed review.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Be specific when you suggest that the writing needs to be improved. If there is
    a particular section that is unclear, point it out and give suggestions for how it can be clarified.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Be specific about novelty. Claims in a review that the submitted work "has been done before" MUST
    be backed up with specific references and an explanation of how closely they are related. At the same time, for a positive review,
    be sure to summarize what novel aspects are most interesting in the strengths.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Citations to papers that have only been published without review (e.g. ArXiv or Technical reports) 
    are not required. Therefore, missing these citations is not grounds for rejecting a paper.</li>
    <li> If you think the paper is out of scope for the workshop subject areas, clearly explain 
    why in the review.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)</h4>
The use of LLMs to write full reviews is not allowed. LLM written reviews are easy to spot and the program committee will 
be rejecting such reviews. You may use LLMs as a writing assistance tool, for example to correct grammar. Reviewers should
understand that they take full responsibility for the contents written under their name, including content generated by
LLMs that could be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts).
